Replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email address, 'noreply@example.com' with the "From" address you want to use for the email, and 'Server Status Notification' with the subject you want for the email.


Now, whenever the server status changes, the script will send an email notification to the specified email address.


Remember to set up the script, including creating a log file, and configure your server's email system correctly.
